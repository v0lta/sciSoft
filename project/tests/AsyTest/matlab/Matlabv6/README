This code is based on the article by Alfredo Deano, Daan Huybrechs and Peter Opsomer. 
Construction and implementation of asymptotic expansions for Jacobi–type orthogonal polynomials.
In preparation. It uses the Riemann-Hilbert analysis from A. B. J. Kuijlaars, 
K. T.-R. McLaughlin, W. Van Assche, and M. Vanlessen. The Riemann-Hilbert approach to strong 
asymptotics of orthogonal polynomials on [−1, 1]. Adv. Math., 188:337–398, 2004.

Main script is computePlotsFromArticle.m, which computes the plots in the 
article through plotConv.m. The script illustrateFunctionality contains a test suite, 
heuristics and Gaussian quadrature. Both call plotConv.m.

Most functions require the (maximum) number of terms in the asymptotic expansions.

asy_lens, asy_outer, asy_right and asy_left evaluate the asymptotic expansion
of the orthogonal polynomials and optionally their derivatives, with a chosen
normalisation. It needs the U-matrices from UQ.m and results Dinf and psi 
from contour_integrals.m, which calls for trap_rule if no exact results are 
known yet.

alphan, betan and gamman evaluate the asymptotic expansion of the recurrence coefficients 
and the leading order coefficients of the orthonormal polynomials using the U-matrices.

UExplicit.m contains the explicit results from the appendix and some additional terms.
Has possible CPU overload when editing. UQ.m calculates the U- and optionally the Q-matrices 
as explained in the paper using Dinf, c and d from contour_integrals.m. It calls for WV.m, 
which carries out the convolutions.

exactPolys computes the exact polynomials we compare against. The OPQ-routines from 
Walter Gautschi that are used in it (gauss and r_jacobi), are included.
